it a fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

Original [README](README.txt)

I started using this software for backing up SD images for a Raspberry Pi project.
It was working fine, but recently it is failing. It is telling my disk does not enough room
to read the SD image. However, I checked my hard drive and it seems like there is plenty of space.
This project hasn't been maintained since 2017. After spending some time trying to figure out whats going on,
I got frustrated and decided to fix the problem myself. In the process, I am hoping I can learn a lot.
